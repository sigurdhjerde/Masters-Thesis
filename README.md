# Master's Thesis - Evaluating Deep Q-Learning Techniques for Controlling Type 1 Diabetes

This repository contains all the algortihms and neural network implementations used during the experimentation phase for my master's thesis [1].
The code is written in Jupyter notebooks with Python 3.8.1 and PyTorch 1.4. The experimantion was done in conjunction with OpenAI Gym, and a repository for that can be seen here: [Gym repository](https://github.com/sigurdhjerde/gym/tree/master_student_branch).
